# Prompt Migration Changelog

## Scope

- Migration window: `e21cb5e` -> `ff7ee14`
- Surface: `prompts/*.md` (30 files)
- Goal: adapt prompt authoring style from XML-like wrappers to Codex-friendly Markdown while preserving role intent and operational constraints.

## Global Changes (Applied to All Prompt Files)

- Preserved frontmatter metadata (`description`, `argument-hint`).
- Replaced wrapper tags such as `<Agent_Prompt>`, `<Role>`, `<Constraints>`, `<Output_Format>`, `<Final_Checklist>` with Markdown section headings.
- Flattened nested XML-like sections into readable Markdown bullets/numbered steps.
- Kept role semantics, tool usage intent, guardrails, and checklist expectations functionally equivalent.

## Behavior Notes

- No intentionally introduced functional behavior changes were made in this migration commit.
- Behavior-relevant content (constraints, verification expectations, output templates) was preserved while syntax/formatting was normalized.
- Any post-migration behavior differences are expected to come from readability and parser-compatibility improvements, not policy changes.

## Validation

- Commit diff summary: `30 files changed, 2439 insertions(+), 2511 deletions(-)`
- Spot-checks performed on role-heavy prompts (`planner`, `executor`, `explore`) confirmed semantic parity with formatting normalization.

## Orchestration Brain Migration (`AGENTS.md`, `templates/AGENTS.md`)

### Summary

These files are the instruction root that OMX expects Codex to follow across a workspace.
Changes here are primarily about aligning instructions with Codex CLI tool contracts.

### Key Deltas

- Updated child-agent delegation guidance to reflect the Codex `spawn_agent` API:
  - Use `spawn_agent(message: "<role prompt>\n\nTask: ...")` conventions.
  - Removed legacy "instructions" phrasing.
- Expanded MCP tooling catalog and mode lifecycle expectations so orchestrators can use the full MCP surface correctly.
- `templates/AGENTS.md` header normalized to match `AGENTS.md` and removed the non-compliant template opener.

### Diff Stats

| File | Added | Removed | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `AGENTS.md` | 42 | 10 | Tooling + delegation guidance expanded; semantics preserved. |
| `templates/AGENTS.md` | 7 | 7 | Header/tone normalized; still intended as a template copy. |

## Skill Prompt Migration (`skills/*/SKILL.md`)

### Summary

Skill docs are operational runbooks. The migration focused on:
- Removing Claude-era paths/terminology
- Aligning config guidance with Codex-first paths (`~/.codex/…`, `CODEX_HOME`)
- Preserving each skill's contract/intent while improving correctness for Codex CLI users

### Behavior Notes

- These are documentation / instruction changes; they do not directly change runtime logic.
- One meaningful correction was made: the "agent teams" enablement guidance in `skills/omx-setup/SKILL.md` was updated to enable Codex features via `~/.codex/config.toml` rather than legacy `settings.json` env vars.

### Hotspots Worth Reviewing

- `skills/omx-setup/SKILL.md`: largest edit surface; includes team enablement guidance (`~/.codex/config.toml` `[features]` flags) and teammate display preference storage (`~/.codex/.omx-config.json`).
- `skills/doctor/SKILL.md`: updated hook/config inspection language; still contains optional legacy remediation guidance.
- `skills/autopilot/SKILL.md`, `skills/research/SKILL.md`, `skills/ultrapilot/SKILL.md`: config examples updated to TOML.
