### Hook Pipeline (6 full + 3 partial out of 9 = ~89%)

| OMC Hook Event | OMX Equivalent | Capability |
|---------------|---------------|------------|
| SessionStart | AGENTS.md native + runtime overlay (preLaunch) | FULL+ |
| PreToolUse | AGENTS.md inline guidance | PARTIAL (no interception) |
| PostToolUse | notify config hook + tmux prompt injection workaround | FULL* |
| UserPromptSubmit | AGENTS.md self-detection | PARTIAL (model-side detection) |
| SubagentStart | Codex CLI multi_agent native | FULL |
| SubagentStop | Codex CLI multi_agent native | FULL |
| PreCompact | AGENTS.md overlay compaction protocol | PARTIAL (instructions only) |
| Stop | notify config + postLaunch cleanup | FULL |
| SessionEnd | omx postLaunch lifecycle phase | PARTIAL (post-exit cleanup) |

`*` FULL via terminal automation workaround (default-enabled in `v0.2.3` generated `.omx/tmux-hook.json`), not native hook context injection.

## Known Gaps

1. **Pre-tool interception** - Cannot intercept tool calls before execution. Workaround: AGENTS.md instructs model to self-moderate.
2. **Native context injection from hooks** - Not available in Codex hooks API. Workaround: tmux prompt injection (`omx tmux-hook`) plus state files + AGENTS.md instructions (default-enabled in `v0.2.3` generated config).
3. **PreCompact hook** - No event interception. Workaround: AGENTS.md overlay includes compaction survival instructions that tell the model to checkpoint state before compaction.
4. **Session end** - No real-time event. Workaround: `omx` wrapper detects Codex exit via blocking execSync and runs postLaunch cleanup (overlay strip, session archive, mode cancellation).
5. **Full LSP protocol** - LSP tools use pragmatic wrappers (tsc, grep, regex) rather than full LSP protocol. Missing: lsp_goto_definition, lsp_prepare_rename, lsp_rename, lsp_code_actions, lsp_code_action_resolve (5 tools need real LSP).
6. **Python REPL** - Not yet ported. Needed only by scientist agent. Low priority for v0.1.0.

## Upstream Contribution Path

To achieve 100% hook parity, these changes need to be contributed to Codex CLI:
1. Add `BeforeToolUse` hook event to `codex-rs/hooks/`
2. Add `UserPromptSubmit` hook event
3. Add external hook configuration in `config.toml` (currently only `notify`)
4. Add hook context injection (hook stdout -> system message)
